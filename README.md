# Univariate-Linear-Regression
Linear Regression with NumPy and Python.

In this project I will implement linear regression with one variable (univariate) to predict the profit for a bike-sharing company.
The three main learning objectives in this project are the following:
1. Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch.
2. Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python.
3. Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib.


Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- Task 1: Load the Data and Libraries
-	Task 2: Visualize the Data
-	Task 3: Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)
-	Task 4: Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python
-	Task 5: Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)
-	Task 6: Plotting the Convergence
-	Task 7: Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit
-	Task 8: Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
