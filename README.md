# Univariate-Linear-Regression
Linear Regression with NumPy and Python.

In this project I will implement linear regression with one variable (univariate) to predict the profit for a bike-sharing company.

### My objective in this project is to learn the following skills:
__1.__ Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch.
__2.__ Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python.
__3.__ Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib.


### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Load the Data and Libraries
-	__Task 2:__ Visualize the Data
-	__Task 3:__ Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)
-	__Task 4:__ Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python
-	__Task 5:__ Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)
-	__Task 6:__ Plotting the Convergence
-	__Task 7:__ Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit
-	__Task 8:__ Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
